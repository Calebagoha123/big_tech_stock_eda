# Exploratory Data Analysis: Big Tech Stocks
I've recently developed an interest in the world of finance. On a whim, I decided to find whatever data I could and see what insights and narratives I could get out of it. 

# Data Collection
Yahoo Finance has a large database of historical stock information for a lot of companies so I downloaded the csv files for the big tech companies and concatenated them into one big dataframe ('big_tech_stoc_prices.csv'). The list of files for each company can be found in the 'data' folder.

# Analysis
The analysis can be found in the 'eda.ipynb' jupyter notebook. Most of the graphs were created with plotly so they are interactive. TLDR of the analysis:
2022 was a historically bad year for big tech companies

I'm currently doing some research as to why to hopefully update this repo with a much more detailed analysis so stay tuned!
